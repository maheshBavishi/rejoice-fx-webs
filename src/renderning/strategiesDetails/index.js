                AI Gen XII EA This is an Expert Advisor with the latest use of trading realities and neural networks. The EA runs on the latest GPT-4o platform and also uses advanced discrete Fourier visualization in ATFNet, which equalizes the frequency spectrum of the input series, allowing for a more complete analysis of time series data. The Expert Advisor can also trade different strategies simultaneously and combine test trades with real trading, which is very important in its time.
